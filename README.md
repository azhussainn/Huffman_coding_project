# Huffman_coding_project

Huffman Coding is a famous Greedy Algorithm. It is used for the lossless compression of data. It uses variable length encoding.
It assigns variable length code to all the characters. The code length of a character depends on how frequently it occurs in the given text.
The character which occurs most frequently gets the smallest code. The character which occurs least frequently gets the largest code.
It is also known as Huffman Encoding.
